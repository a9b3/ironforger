# Ironforger
Use ironforger as a manager for directories you would like to be able to
just simply paste into anywhere through the ironforger CLI. You can create
symlinks to folders you would like to save to ironforger in ironforger's recipes
folder. From then running the ironforger command will list your symlink and choosing
it will essentially paste it into your current directory.

```
npm install -g ironforger

ironforger
```
